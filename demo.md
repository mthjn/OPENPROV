####Demonstration
With the exception of vanity address generation we have performed this demonstration on an inexpensive Raspberry Pi 2 computer.
For this demonstration we will be using the Open Provenance vanity address as our bitcoin signing key (1openPBE4b7hTJ5Q6oZGgaHpxG2bC2h32) and a PGP key attributed to Open Provenance (openprov@myveryown.org).  
We will use the following two bitcoin addresses for the proof of creation and genesis provenance string transactions:

**Creation Address: __1opCKbbxvesveMjTZLiBUXqxvtVGz8CQG__**

**Genesis Address: __1opGKy6dQJEjmGHc2fdRrXLX6GKsdkqqU__**

We will then transfer ownership of the object to the following addresses, to create a chain of provenance:

**Initial Purchaser: __1B1RK3FjdG4WxRMwPfG3c4tTvd58DpUr1S__**

**Subsequent Purchaser: __1B2RKXwzU2rBChZbLktELR6gL2vuu71UC9__**

The object we will work with for this demonstration is a photograph taken recently in London by Toby Connors who has kindly donated it to this project. The original raw format (.CR2) and XMP files will be PGP  encrypted and a post production (.JPG) file will be signed and can be found within the .ZIP file linked below along with the described OPENPROV.TXT and other associated files.


#####Step 1

https://myveryown.org/pgp.txt

https://myveryown.org/declaration.txt

Please see Appendices A and B  for PGP key generation and strengthening commands.  Please see Appendix C for bitcoin vanity address generation commands and Appendix D for cross signing your keys.

The following screenshots show you how to generate/verify a signature in Electrum.

![demo 02](https://myveryown.org/demo/screens/openprov-demo_02.jpg)


#####Step 2
We then PGP encrypt the supplied .CR2 and .XMP files and sign a post production JPG copy of the photo.

https://myveryown.org/demo/london.xmp.txt

![london](https://myveryown.org/demo/london.jpg)

https://myveryown.org/demo/london.jpg.txt

Please see Appendix E for more information on Encrypting, Signing, Verifying, Hashing and Zipping.

#####Step 3
We then create an OPENPROV.TXT file and signed it with both our PGP key and bitcoin vanity address. https://myveryown.org/demo/openprov.txt

![demo 03](https://myveryown.org/demo/screens/openprov-demo_03.jpg)

![demo 04](https://myveryown.org/demo/screens/openprov-demo_04.jpg)

![demo 05](https://myveryown.org/demo/screens/openprov-demo_05.jpg)

We used the [openprov.txt template file](https://myveryown.org/template.zip)


#####Step 4
Then we collate additional files: license.txt, openprov.nfo, FILE_ID.DIZ.

#####Step 5
We then hashed the data.
https://myveryown.org/demo/sha256.txt

We then made a [zip of the aforementioned 11 files](https://myveryown.org/demo/openprov.zip)

Please see Appendix E for information on zipping files.

#####Step 6
The calculated SHA256 hash of the .ZIP link in Step 5 is as follows:

*77A2BB6D9B937185B08ADA025DAB3B7A9801667288CF03BCC12E0CFAF755A88D*

#####Step 7
The bitcoin key pair generated as a result of using the SHA256 hash of our object as the private key is as follows:

Address: 1K9zXU3qoGaWYocJjPqygJrLvMcyrnaC1D

Priv Key: 5JiyWmzwnywZbk98GU8bdtfZ9o6bxBjfcuhtWVNT1wVCCh9HTFk

Pub Key: 04A4FB38F91D42B829DA25E1C9D4B182D65621DDF194ACED3C70A1105FCBC5754E003D6974088F06FE55F974E987B22B895A1FFC2496E8D519F2F4B6BC158B58E2

This key pair creates a direct representation of our object in the blockchain.

The following screen shots detail how we obtained the bitcoin address using our SHA256 hash as a private key using bitaddress.org locally. 

![demo 06](https://myveryown.org/demo/screens/openprov-demo_06.jpg)

![demo 07](https://myveryown.org/demo/screens/openprov-demo_07.jpg)

#####Step 8
TX A: https://blockchain.info/tx/50e30265604e888c384796675bc246f2dc9f8ed6aa9d5854bcd778765ae7feb8 

TX B: As we are working with a digital object e.g. a .JPG we are going to use part of the suggested enhancement and place its SHA256 hash prefixed with OPENPROV into the input transaction of the object key pair, e.g. 

4f50454e50524f56AAF0AE08EB31243C05A1A785C302CC4BC7A384E02F8A12FF7DA17BD33414F10B

We use coinb.in locally to 

Create

If you were working with a physical object then a standard P2PKH transaction would be sufficient.

TX C: The OP_RETURN transaction data in the output transaction and all subsequent transactions is then as follows: 

*4f50454e50524f5677A2BB6D9B937185B08ADA025DAB3B7A9801667288CF03BCC12E0CFAF755A88D*

Then again using coinb.in to create, sign, verify and broadcast the transaction.

#####Step 9
We use bitaddress locally to obtain public keys from the private keys we wish to use in the multisig.

![demo](https://myveryown.org/demo/screens/openprov-demo_25.jpg)

Then using coinb.in locally create a multisig address and redeem script.

![demo](https://myveryown.org/demo/screens/openprov-demo_26.jpg) 

Please see Appendix F for the keys used to create the multisig so you are able to verify the process.

#####Step 10

The multisig address is then funded from the Genesis key and this transaction includes the same OP_RETURN data as Step 8 TX C e.g.

*4f50454e50524f5677A2BB6D9B937185B08ADA025DAB3B7A9801667288CF03BCC12E0CFAF755A88D*

We use coinb.in locally to create, sign and broadcast the transaction.

#####Step 12
Usiing coinb.in locally we create, sign, verify and broadcast the first transaction.

Then we create, sign and broadcast the second transaction which includes the OP_RETURN data found in Steps 8 TX C and Step 10.

*4f50454e50524f5677A2BB6D9B937185B08ADA025DAB3B7A9801667288CF03BCC12E0CFAF755A88D*

#####Appendix A - Generating a PGP Key
Please note it takes time to generate a 4096 bit key on the Raspberry Pi 2.  You will need to create entropy so we suggest you open a second SSH session to the pi and run some commands.  

Make sure to pick a long and unique passphrase. If your key gets stolen, this passphrase is the only thing protecting it!

The following is the screen dump from running PGP

You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 278 more bytes)

You are then able to export the keys for backup using the following commands:

To obtain your public key in text format use:
````
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ gpg --export -a openprov@myveryown.org > pgppublic.txt
````

To obtain your private key in text format use:
````
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ gpg --export-secret-key -a openprov@myveryown.org > pgpsecret.txt
````

#####Appendix C - Generating Vanity Bitcoin Addresses and Private Keys
As great as the Raspberry Pi 2 is, it is not really suited to brute forcing bitcoin vanity addresses.  We suggest you use a more powerful computer for this task.  

Vanitygen is available in a few flavours, there are 32 and 64 bit versions, as well as an OCL optimised version, use the best you can for maximum speed.

The exact command you will use will depend on the version you are using - here are some examples:

For the 32bit .exe the command to generate our vanity address would be as follows
````
c:\vanitygen> vanitygen 1openP
````
For the 64bit .exe the command to generate our vanity address would be as follows
````
c:\vanitygen> vanitygen64 1openP
````
For the OCL .exe the command to generate our vanity address would be as follows
````
c:\vanitygen> oclvanitygen -D 0:0 1openP
````
The -D switch is used to specify the GPU to use which in our case is 0:0.  If you do not specify which GPU to use it will show you a list of available options.

The expected output would read something like
````
Difficulty: 15318045009

[3.42 Mkey/s][total 50331648][Prob 0.3%][50% in 51.5min]
````

Once the search is complete you will see something like.  
````

Pattern: 1openP

Address:1openPBE4b7hTJ5Q6oZGgaHpxG2bC2h32

Priv Key: **************************************************
````

######Please note:  

We have replaced the private key in the above example with asterisks for security reasons.

Even with a GPU it may take some time depending on how many keys per second you are able to generate to find an address that matches your search.

#####Appendix D - Cross Signing your Bitcoin Vanity Address and PGP Key
To cross sign your PGP Key with your bitcoin vanity address, first export your PGP Public key into a file e.g.

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **gpg --export -a openprov@myveryown.org > pgp.txt**

Then add to the top of the file your bitcoin address e.g. “Bitcoin Address: 1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX”

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **nano pgp.txt**

(add your bitcoin address to the top of the file)

Press ctrl+x to exit nano, answer y to save the changes.

Then sign the file with PGP e.g.
pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **gpg --clearsign --digest-algo SHA256 pgp.txt**
This will result in a pgp.txt.asc file that contains the PGP signed, copy of your public key and bitcoin address.  Delete the pgp.txt and rename pgp.txt.asc to pgp.txt

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **rm pgp.txt**

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **mv pgp.txt.asc pgp.txt**

Then copy the contents of this file into the Electrum message signing dialog and click sign.  

Update the pgp.txt file with the bitcoin signature as shown and save the file.  

#####Appendix E - Encrypting, Signing, Verifying, Hashing and Zipping
Where applicable you will need to replace the email address and files names as appropriate with your own.  To encrypt data use the following commands: (Commands/Options are displayed in bold)

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **gpg -e -a -r openprov@myveryown.org london.cr2**

This will result in a london.cr2.asc file which is a ciphertext which we rename to .txt

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **mv london.cr2.asc london.cr2.txt**

In this case we also wish to remove the unencrypted file from this folder

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **rm london.cr2**

We repeated the above for the london.xmp file we were also supplied.

To sign binary data use the following commands:

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **gpg --detach-sign -a --digest-algo SHA256 london.jpg**

This will result in a london.jpg.asc signature file which we rename to .txt

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **mv london.jpg.asc london.jpg.txt**

To sign text data use the following commands:

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **gpg --clearsign --digest-algo SHA256 declaration.txt**

This will result in a declaration.txt.asc file which we rename to .txt

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **rm declaration.txt**

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **mv declaration.txt.asc declaration.txt**

To hash all files in a folder to a single text file use the following command:

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **gpg  --print-md SHA256 *.* >> sha256.txt**

This will result in the SHA256 hash of all collated input files being added to the sha256.txt file.

To verify a signature use the following commands:

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **gpg --verify pgp.txt**

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **gpg --verify london.jpg.txt london.jpg**

To ZIP all files in a folder use the following command:

pi@raspberrypi ~ $ **zip openprov.zip *.***
